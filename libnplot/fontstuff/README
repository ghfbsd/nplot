This directory contains the fonts that nplot and friends use for plotting.

The font files are named, fontxxx, where xxx is a code giving the font
number.  The coding of the fonts in given in the subroutine nfont, defined
in the 'font.c' module of nplot.

The files named fontxxx.def are a font definition, in human-readable form.
These files are read by buildfont and transformed into a fontxxx file.

To build a font, catenate the Hershey fonts into a single stream and
for input to buildfont, along with the fontxxx file and the fontxxx.def
file as such:
   cat Hershey_fonts/hersh.oc* | buildfont font001 font001.def
This will produce the font file 'font001' from the definition given by
'font001.def'.

The Hershey fonts, as received, contain at least one error.  To date, the
errors found so far are:
  3010 (cap J) - right-hand width was wrong; should be Z (+8) not J (-8)
