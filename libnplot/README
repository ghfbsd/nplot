Modification history:
11/81:  New version for FORTRAN.    Hitoshi Kawakatsu 11/20/81
6/82:	Minor changes subroutine renamed nplot.c
	and set up for nu pdp11/44, Seth Stein

1983:	Subroutine axmi() modified for constant functions, Craig Bina

6/84:	Minor modifications to para(19) storage option, Seth Stein

1985:	Modified for variable plotfile names, Craig Bina

6/85:	VAX VERSION - All integers changed to short (ie 2 bytes) 
	This is crucial for those written out to "pltfil" 
	as pen,tek expect this (2 bytes in "write" commands, which use
	the "geth" command).
	This also eliminates discrepancies between variables defined 
	in some places as short and others as int, which are no longer
	equivalent.  Minor bug related to string length in labels fixed.
	Some stylistic changes also made
	in response to VAX C compiler warnings. Seth Stein

8/85:	Subroutines nline and nmove added.  Line thickness option added.
	John Werner

11/85:	Modified to plot polygons, Craig Bina

1/86:	Modified for smaller default plot area (due to Imagen), S. Stein.

2/86:	Modified to fix auto-scaling of origin placement
	(nlabel.c incidentally combined into nplot.c); C. Bina
	modified to fix rounding errors in nform(); C. Bina
	modified to attempt fix of polygon initialization calls; C. Bina

2/86:	Modified to allow dashed lines, extending para() via para(14), C. Bina
 
8/88:   Add plus and cross symbols.
        G. Helffrich 8/15/88.
 
6/99:   Add code to use Fortran character string length.
